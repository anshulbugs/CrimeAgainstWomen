## Crimes Against Women in India (2001-2014)

**Introduction:**
This project aims to analyze and reflect upon the situation of women in Indian society, focusing on crimes against women in India from the years 2001 to 2014. The dataset used in this project contains records of various types of crimes committed against women during this period. The primary goal is to raise awareness about this critical issue and shed light on the challenges faced by women in India.

**Data Source:**
The dataset used in this project is in CSV format and contains information about crimes against women in India. The data spans the years 2001 to 2014 and includes various attributes such as the type of crime, state or union territory where the crime occurred, the number of reported cases, and more.

**Importing Data and Data Cleaning:**
The initial steps of the project involve importing the dataset and performing data cleaning to prepare the data for analysis. The data cleaning process includes checking for null or missing values and addressing any inconsistencies or errors in the data. For instance, redundant columns like "District" and "Unnamed: 0" are dropped as they do not contribute to the analysis.

**Exploratory Analysis and Visualization:**
After data cleaning, the project delves into exploratory analysis and visualization. Key aspects such as the total population of women victimized by different crimes during the years 2001 to 2014 are analyzed. The project also provides bar charts to visualize the trends in different types of crimes over the years. Heatmaps are used to illustrate how the number of reported cases has increased over time in different states.

**Important Questions and Analysis:**
To draw significant conclusions from the dataset, the project poses critical questions and attempts to find answers to them. The questions cover various categories of crimes against women, such as rape, dowry deaths, domestic violence, kidnapping, and abduction. For each category, the project identifies the top states with the highest number of reported cases during the 2001-2014 period.

**Inferences and Conclusion:**
The project concludes by summarizing the findings from the data analysis. It emphasizes the severity of crimes against women in India and highlights the states that have reported the highest number of cases for different crime categories. The analysis reveals that crimes against women have increased over the years, reflecting a concerning situation for women in Indian society.

**Future Work:**
The project acknowledges the importance of further research on women's safety and suggests future work in this area. It expresses the intention to explore datasets beyond the scope of India, extending the analysis to encompass global data related to crimes against women.

**References:**
The project provides a list of references used during the analysis, including websites like Stack Overflow, Pandas documentation, Matplotlib documentation, and W3Schools, which were consulted to gain insights and clarity on coding and data manipulation.
